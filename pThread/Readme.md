# Matrix multiplication using PThreads

- Use a data structure of your choice to represent the matrix. You have been given the code to generate input matrices. The code generates matrices as csv files.
- You will be multiplying two square matrices. Use the code given to generate two different matrices of the same size (nxn) and multiply them.
- Examine the format of the input file. The output should be the same format as the input.
- Use the code you wrote in <a href="https://github.com/PureDevPer/Distributed-and-Parallel-Computing/tree/master/MatMul%2C%20pThreads">optimized serial mat mul</a> â€“ Convert that to parallel
  implementation
- Tip: Start with small matrix sizes (say 4x4 or even 2x2), Consider the use of condition vars,
  mutexes properly

**Serial and Parallel Implementations**

You will do both serial and parallel implementations of matrix multiplication
