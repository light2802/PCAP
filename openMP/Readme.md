- Use a data structure of your choice to represent the matrix. You have been given the code to generate input matrices (use from previous homework). The code generates matrices as csv files.
- You will be multiplying two square matrices. Use the code given to generate two different matrices of the same size (nxn) and multiply them.
- Examine the format of the input file. The output should be the same format as the input.
- Tip: Start with small matrix sizes (say 4x4 or even 2x2)
